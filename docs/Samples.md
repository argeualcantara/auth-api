# API Authentication System - Sample Documentation

This documentation provides sample code snippets demonstrating how to use the API Authentication System to register users, authenticate users, and manage user sessions.

## Registering a New User

To register a new user, send a POST request to the `/register` endpoint with the user's details (username, email, password) in the request body.

### Example (using Python requests library):

```python
import requests

url = 'https://api.authsystem.com/v1/register'
data = {'username': 'example_user', 'email': 'user@example.com', 'password': 'password123'}
response = requests.post(url, json=data)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print('User registration successful.')
else:
    print('User registration failed:', response.text)
```

## Authenticating a User

To authenticate a user and obtain an access token, send a POST request to the `/login` endpoint with the user's email and password in the request body.

### Example (using Python requests library):

```python
import requests

url = 'https://api.authsystem.com/v1/login'
data = {'email': 'user@example.com', 'password': 'password123'}
response = requests.post(url, json=data)

if response.status_code == 200:
    access_token = response.json()['access_token']
    print('Access token:', access_token)
else:
    print('Authentication failed:', response.text)
```

## Managing User Sessions

To manage user sessions, use the access token obtained during authentication. Include the access token in the headers of subsequent requests to authenticate the user.

### Example (using Python requests library):

```python
import requests

url = 'https://api.example.com/v1/protected/resource'
headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>'}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print('Resource accessed successfully.')
else:
    print('Access denied:', response.text)
```

## Conclusion

These sample code snippets demonstrate how to use the API Authentication System to register users, authenticate users, and manage user sessions. By following these examples, you can integrate authentication into your application and secure your API endpoints effectively.
