## Authentication System API - FAQ

### 1. What is the purpose of the Authentication System API?
The Authentication System API is designed to handle user authentication and management within a system. It provides endpoints for user registration, login, profile management, and logout functionalities.

### 2. What is JWT authentication?
JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication is a method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. In our API, JWT tokens are used for user authentication. Upon successful login, the API generates a token that the client can include in subsequent requests to authenticate the user.

### 3. How do I register a new user?
To register a new user, you need to send a POST request to the `/register` endpoint with the user's username, email, and password in the request body.

### 4. How do I log in a user?
To log in a user, you need to send a POST request to the `/login` endpoint with the user's email and password in the request body. Upon successful authentication, the API will respond with a JWT token that you can use for subsequent authenticated requests.

### 5. How do I retrieve a user's profile information?
To retrieve a user's profile information, you need to send a GET request to the `/profile` endpoint with the user's JWT token included in the request headers. The API will then return the user's profile data.

### 6. How do I update a user's profile?
To update a user's profile, you need to send a PUT request to the `/profile` endpoint with the updated profile information in the request body. The request must also include the user's JWT token in the headers for authentication.

### 7. How do I log out a user?
To log out a user and invalidate their JWT token, you need to send a POST request to the `/logout` endpoint with the user's JWT token included in the request headers. Upon successful logout, the API will respond with a confirmation message.

### 8. What happens if my JWT token expires?
If your JWT token expires, you will need to log in again to obtain a new token. Expiration times for JWT tokens can be configured server-side.

### 9. Is the Authentication System API secure?
Yes, the Authentication System API is designed with security in mind. It uses industry-standard JWT authentication for secure user authentication and transmission of data.

### 10. Can I integrate this API with my existing application?
Yes, the Authentication System API is designed to be easily integrable with various applications and platforms. You can use HTTP requests to interact with the API endpoints from your application or website.
