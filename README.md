# API Authentication System

The API Authentication System is a secure and robust solution for authenticating users and managing access to APIs. It provides authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access protected resources.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allow users to register for an account.
- **User Login**: Authenticate users with their credentials and issue access tokens.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Use access tokens for authentication in subsequent API requests.
- **User Profile Management**: Enable users to update their profile information.
- **Token Revocation**: Allow users to revoke access tokens to log out or invalidate sessions.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

## Getting Started

To get started with the API Authentication System, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Install the API Authentication System on your server or cloud environment.
2. **Configuration**: Configure the system settings, including database connection and security parameters.
3. **User Registration**: Allow users to register for an account using the provided registration endpoint.
4. **User Login**: Authenticate users with their credentials and issue access tokens for API access.
5. **Token-Based Authentication**: Use access tokens in the headers of API requests for authentication.
6. **User Profile Management**: Enable users to update their profile information as needed.
7. **Token Revocation**: Implement token revocation functionality to allow users to log out or invalidate sessions.

## API Endpoints

- **User Registration**: `/register` (POST)
- **User Login**: `/login` (POST)
- **User Profile**: `/profile` (GET, PUT)
- **Token Revocation**: `/logout` (POST)

## Example Usage

Below is an example of how to use the API Authentication System API with Python's requests library:

```python
import requests

# API Authentication System API base URL
base_url = 'https://api.authsystem.com/v1'

# Function to register a new user
def register_user(username, email, password):
    url = f'{base_url}/register'
    data = {'username': username, 'email': email, 'password': password}
    response = requests.post(url, json=data)
    return response.json()

# Example usage: Register a new user
registration_result = register_user('user123', 'user123@example.com', 'password123')
print('Registration Result:', registration_result)
```

## Conclusion

The API Authentication System provides a secure and reliable solution for authenticating users and managing access to APIs. With features for user registration, login, token-based authentication, user profile management, and token revocation, the API Authentication System simplifies the process of securing APIs and protecting resources.
